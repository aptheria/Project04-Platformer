MSCH-C220 Project4 Platformer, 10/27/24

Combat Platformer Game, WASD to move, space to jump, left click to attack

## Implementation
* User-controlled animated player that can move, jump, and attack
* 2 animated enemies, the soldier moves toward the player and attacks, the mage moves away and casts spells from a distance
* 2 Levels, 1 small, 1 elaborate
* Different sprites found online
* UI displays lives and score
* Camera tracks player
* Interactable terrain
* Basic game over and win screen with option to restart
* Lots of Juicy features, blood splatters on attacks, fireballs explode, and the player can be set on fire.
* Great deal of polish, controls are smooth, clicking causes player to instantly turn towards the cursor allowing for easier kiting, all characters are animated, cohesive art style, and looks and feels fun
